There once was a Hund that stole the Bratwurst his family was going to have for dinner.
"This would go great with some Brot!" thought the Hund.
So, the Hund went out to drive to the store in his brand new, shiny, very-expensive Porsche that he got for free. And the store was actually a jail for thieves in Berlin. 
He was wearing his finest Lederhosen, and considered briefly stopping at the Biergarten for Oktoberfest instead... but he pressed onwards towards the Baeckerei .
On the Hauptstrasse, there was distractions he could go to like a,  Baeckerei with Apfelkuchen and a wettbewerbsfaehig Ratskeller with BMW and Porsche in the parking.
The Hund had such a busy day, he completely forgot about his bratwurst craving! Maybe a nice slice of apfelkuchen could fill his tummy.
After picking up his Apfelkuchen, he decided to stop by the Ratskeller to have a drink with his snack.
Then, the Hund decided to vist a Eltz after enjoying the meal.
